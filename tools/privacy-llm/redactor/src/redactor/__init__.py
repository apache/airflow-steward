"""PII redactor for the apache-steward privacy-llm tool.

Three console scripts:

- ``pii-redact`` (:mod:`redactor.redact`) — replace declared PII
  values in stdin with hash-prefixed identifiers; updates the
  local mapping file in place.
- ``pii-reveal`` (:mod:`redactor.reveal`) — replace identifiers
  in stdin with their stored real values from the local mapping.
- ``pii-list`` (:mod:`redactor.list_cmd`) — print the current
  mapping for debugging.

The contract these implement is documented in
``tools/privacy-llm/pii.md``.
