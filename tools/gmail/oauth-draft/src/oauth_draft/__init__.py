"""Gmail OAuth helpers for threadId-attached drafts and bulk thread modifications.

Three console scripts:

- ``oauth-draft-setup`` — one-time interactive OAuth consent flow that
  writes the credentials JSON.
- ``oauth-draft-create`` — create a Gmail draft attached to a thread by
  ``threadId`` (the claude.ai Gmail MCP cannot do this).
- ``oauth-draft-mark-read`` — bulk-modify Gmail threads matching a
  search query (default: mark as read).

The module-level entry points are re-exported here so callers can do
``from oauth_draft import create_draft_main`` etc. if they prefer over
the console-script form.
